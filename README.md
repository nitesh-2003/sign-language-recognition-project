# sign-language-recognition-project

In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.

We have developed this project using OpenCV and Keras modules of python.

Prerequisites
The prerequisites software & libraries for the sign language project are:

Python (3.7.4)
IDE (Jupyter)
Numpy (version 1.16.5)
cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)
Keras (version 2.3.1)
Tensorflow (as keras uses tensorflow in backend and for image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)

This is divided into 3 parts:

Creating the dataset
Training a CNN on the captured dataset
Predicting the data

We have successfully developed sign language detection project. This is an interesting machine learning python project to gain expertise. This can be further extended for detecting the English alphabets.
